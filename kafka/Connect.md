- Source connectors interface with the source API and extract the payload + schema of the data, and pass this internally as a generic representation of the data.
- Sink connectors work in reverseâ€”they take a generic representation of the data, and the sink connector plugin writes that to the target system using its API.

### Converters

Converters are responsible for the serialization and deserialization of data flowing between Kafka Connect and Kafka itself.


### Transforms
Unlike connectors and converters, these are entirely optional.
