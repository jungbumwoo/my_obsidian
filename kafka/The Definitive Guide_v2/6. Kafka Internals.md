##  Cluster Membership

- Kafka uses Apache ZooKeeper to maintain the list of brokers that are currently mem‚Äê bers of a cluster. 
- Every broker has a unique identifier that is either set in the broker configuration file or automatically generated. E
- Every time a broker process starts, it registers itself with its ID in ZooKeeper by creating an [ephemeral node](https://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/r3.4.8/zookeeperProgrammers.html#Ephemeral+Nodes).
