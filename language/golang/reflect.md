Go is statically typed. Every variable has a static type, that is, exactly one type known and fixed at compile time.

One important category of type is interface types, which represent fixed sets of methods. (When discussing reflection, we can ignore the use of interface definitions as constraints within polymorphic code.) An interface variable can store any concrete (non-interface) value as long as that value implements the interfaceâ€™s methods.
